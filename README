FAQ:
Q: What if I want to make an incremental commit, but I'm not ready to update the ticket?
A: There are a several of options in this case.  

1.  You can go ahead and commit, leaving out the bug #,
and later rebase your incremental commits into a single commit with the bug #.

2.  You can make a commit without the bug #, and make additional incremental commits
using the --amend option to the git commit command. When you are ready to update the bug,
you can use the --amend option one last time and add the bug # to the commit message.

3. Go ahead and commit with the bug # in the commit. It's ok if there are several commits
associated with a bug, just as long as they all show up in the bug's comments.

PLEASE NOTE:

Your commit ids won't be visible in github until you push to github.
